# MERN Login and Registration

This is a simple Login and Registration project based on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to register their details and store them in a NoSQL MongoDB database. After successful registration, users can log in using their credentials and view their details on a card displayed on the welcome page.

## Features

- User registration: Users can create an account by providing their details, which are then stored in a MongoDB database.
- User login: Registered users can log in using their credentials (username and password).
- Welcome page: After successful login, users are redirected to a welcome page where they can view their details on a card.
